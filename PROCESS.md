**AI Foundry** adopts [Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/) as the foundation for all its development processes. This approach includes daily stand-ups, weekly retrospectives, and pair programming to foster collaboration and continuous improvement. 

The organization is divided into three primary groups: 
-  **Founding Team**, executive level of the organization;
-  **Anchor Team**, responsible for specific swim lanes or projects development;
- **Community Contributors Team** , core members of AI Foundry Community

Each Anchor Team comprises both Machine Learning (ML) and Engineering experts who may also serve as internal champions.
### Founding Team 

The Founding Team drives AI Foundry's vision, strategy and product. As of now It includes:

- CEO: Leads the company, sets strategic direction, and manages external relations.
- CTO: Oversees technical strategy and innovation, aligning technology with company goals.
- VP of Engineering: Manages engineering teams, ensuring efficient processes and alignment with objectives.
- CMO: Directs marketing efforts, enhancing brand and market presence.

### Anchor Team 

At the core of the Anchor Team is the **Champion**, an engineer who acts as the technical leader. The Champion not only has a strong technical background but also plays a crucial role in team leadership and executive decision-making. Their deep understanding of the team’s product must match that of the product manager.

Typically, the team includes **Engineers** who are responsible for the technical implementation. These individuals possess a robust technical background and a comprehensive understanding of the team’s product—how it functions and its purpose.

In addition to Engineers, the team also includes **AI/ML Researchers**. These researchers lead the efforts in model research, training, and development, ensuring seamless integration with the engineering aspects of the product.

An Anchor Team typically consists of:

- 1 or 2 Champions (1 from Engineering, 1 from ML)
- 1 or more Engineers
- 1 or more AI/ML Researchers
### Community Contributors Team
The Community Contributors Team is composed of core members from the AI Foundry community who actively contribute to the organization's projects and initiatives. 

- Community Leaders: Experienced contributors who provide guidance andact as bridges between the community and the Anchor Teams.
- Contributors: A diverse group of volunteers and open-source enthusiasts who contribute to various projects, from code development to documentation, testing, and more.

### Extreme Programming

At AI Foundry, we fully embrace Extreme Programming (XP) with a strong commitment to open-source principles from day one. All our activities, from development to decision-making, are conducted transparently in public in our Discord server. Our XP practices include daily stand-ups, weekly retrospectives, and bi-weekly planning meetings, all of which are held in our Discord channel. In addition to these team-level activities, we also conduct organization-wide events, such as monthly reviews and community podcasts.
#### Daily Stand-Up
Daily standup is a daily synchronisation that occurs at team level and follows this format:

1. What members did the previous day and what they plan to do today
2. Anything that members may be stuck or blocked on
3. Announcements, Interesting events in the form of tech news or local events

At the end of each stand-up, the team should have their updated board of tasks and its statuses.
#### Bi-Weekly Retrospectives

Retrospectives are conducted every two weeks at both the team and organizational levels. During these sessions, Champions lead the discussion on a shared retro platform, where team members can freely express their thoughts, whether it’s frustration over a persistent bug or satisfaction from a recent achievement.

The retro includes a facilitated discussion on each item, with a time limit of 5 minutes per topic. There is also an Action Items section to address specific points raised during the retro. For example, if someone asks about the next team podcast, an action item would be created to decide on the podcast's topic.

#### Bi-Weekly Planning

**Iteration/Sprint Planning Meetings** are held bi-weekly and facilitated by the team Champions. These meetings are crucial for aligning the team’s work with feedback-driven development. When the Founding Team requests a new feature, or at the Champion’s discretion, a "Story" is created to represent the unit of work.

The Champion is responsible for crafting clear and concise Stories that include a **Title, Description, Acceptance Criteria**, and **Resources**. During the planning meeting, the team reviews these Stories, discusses technical implementation details, and resolves any questions. The team then assigns a difficulty value to each Story through a process called “Pointing,” which is done simultaneously to avoid bias.

This structured approach ensures that the team remains focused, aligned, and continuously improving.

#### Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria
The **Definition of Done (DoD)** is a clear, shared understanding within the team of what it means for a task or feature to be considered complete. It serves as a checklist that ensures consistency and quality across all deliverables. A task is only marked as "done" when it meets all the criteria outlined in the DoD, which typically includes:

- Code has been written, reviewed, and merged.
- All tests (unit, integration, etc.) have been passed.
- Documentation has been updated, including code comments and external documentation if applicable.
- The feature or fix has been successfully deployed to the appropriate environment.
- Acceptance criteria have been met and validated by the relevant stakeholders.

**Acceptance Criteria** are specific conditions that a deliverable must satisfy to be accepted by the team or stakeholders. These criteria are defined in the early stages of the task or feature's lifecycle and are included in the "Story" created by the team Champion. Acceptance Criteria typically include:

- Functional requirements: What the feature should do.
- Non-functional requirements: Performance, security, and usability standards.
- Edge cases: Scenarios that need to be handled to ensure robustness.
- User experience considerations: How the end-user should interact with the feature.

Together, the Definition of Done and Acceptance Criteria ensure that all work is completed to a high standard, aligning with both technical requirements and user expectations.
